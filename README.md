Various configuration files I use across all machines I have access to.

## Dependencies

You should have [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) installed in 
`~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`. You can have that with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azag0/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
bash install.sh
```

Also, you might want to change your name and email in `.gitconfig`
